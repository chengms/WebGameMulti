# GameTime Bar Project Overview

GameTime Bar is a web-based gaming platform that hosts and displays multiple web games in a unified interface. It allows users to browse, search, and play various HTML5 games in English.

## Key Features

- Game catalog with filtering by categories and search functionality
- Responsive design for various screen sizes and devices
- Individual game detail pages with metadata and game embedding
- User settings and preferences system
- Multiple integrated games with consistent English UI
- Modern gaming entertainment hub experience

## Key Technologies

- **React**: Frontend framework for component-based architecture
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages and game routing
- **Context API**: For state management and data sharing
- **CSS Modules**: For component styling and responsive design
- **HTML5 Games**: Individual games integrated into the platform
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server

## Main Entry Points

- [index.html](mdc:index.html): HTML entry point with GameTime Bar branding
- [src/main.jsx](mdc:src/main.jsx): JavaScript entry point
- [src/App.jsx](mdc:src/App.jsx): Main application component with routing

## Game Integration

**CRITICAL**: Games MUST be placed in the [games](mdc:games) directory and loaded through the game loader utility at [src/utils/gameLoader.js](mdc:src/utils/gameLoader.js).

## Language Requirements

**ALL user-facing content MUST be in English**, including:
- UI elements and navigation
- Game names and descriptions
- Error messages and notifications  
- Form labels and placeholders

## Project Structure

- [games](mdc:games): Directory containing all game implementations
- [src/components](mdc:src/components): Reusable React components
- [src/pages](mdc:src/pages): Page-level components
- [src/contexts](mdc:src/contexts): React context providers
- [src/utils](mdc:src/utils): Utility functions and game loading logic
