# Components and Pages Guide

This guide explains the structure of components and pages in the WebGameMulti platform.

## Component Organization

Components are organized in the [src/components](mdc:src/components) directory:

- `layout/`: Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Layout)
- `game/`: Game-related components (GameCard, GameControls)

## Page Organization

Pages are organized in the [src/pages](mdc:src/pages) directory:

- `Home/`: Home page with game listing
- `GameDetail/`: Game detail page for displaying and playing games
- `Settings/`: User settings page
- `About/`: About page with platform information
- `NotFound/`: 404 page

## Key Components

### Layout Components

- `Layout`: Main layout container with header, sidebar, and content area
- `Header`: Top navigation bar with search and user controls
- `Sidebar`: Side navigation with categories and filters

### Game Components

- `GameCard`: Card component for displaying game thumbnails and basic info
- `GameDetail`: Detailed game information and game embedding

## Routing

Routing is managed in [App.jsx](mdc:src/App.jsx) using React Router. The main routes are:

- `/`: Home page
- `/games/:gameId`: Game detail page
- `/settings`: Settings page
- `/about`: About page
