  "fullDescription": "<p>2048 is an addictive sliding puzzle game that challenges your strategic thinking. The rules are simple: slide tiles on a grid to combine matching numbers, doubling their value each time they merge. Starting with 2s and 4s, you need to create a tile with the number 2048.</p><p>Every move spawns a new tile (usually a 2, sometimes a 4), gradually filling up the board. Plan your moves carefully to avoid running out of space. Can you reach 2048, or even beyond?</p>",
