  "fullDescription": "<p>Tetris is one of the most iconic puzzle games of all time. The goal is simple: rotate and arrange falling blocks (tetrominoes) to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is complete, it disappears, and you earn points.</p><p>The game gets progressively faster as you level up, testing your reflexes and strategic thinking. How long can you last before the blocks stack up to the top?</p>",
